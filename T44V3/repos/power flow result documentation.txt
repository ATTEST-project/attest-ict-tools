To obtain the results of the Power Flow, one needs to use either:
power_flow_normal_result["all_results"] for normal operation and
power_flow_contin_result["all_results"] for post contingency operation

1- the magnitude of voltages for bus i
2- the angle of voltages for bus i
3- the summation of injected active power flow of lines connected to node i
4- the summation of injected reactive power flow of lines connected to node i
5- the summation of injected active power of components (gen, load, FL, ess,...) connected to node i
6- the summation of injected reactive power of components (gen, load, FL, ess,...) connected to node i

power_flow_contin_result["all_results"][[c,s,t]][:p_cal] and the symbols are self-explanatory as:

:q_cal
:q_sch
:p_sch
:v_mag
:p_cal
:v_ang
